COMPARING ACADEMIES AND LA MAINTAINED SCHOOLS
=============================================

Using [Watchsted](http://www.watchsted.com/) data, a [new
report](http://www.angelsolutions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Academies-and-LA-maintained-schools.pdf "LA maintained schools and academies")
has been compiled to look at national performance across Academies and
LA maintained schools.

This report considers an alternative way of presenting performance data,
using the latest Ofsted framework but excluding converter academy
predecessor grades.

SPONSORED ACADEMIES
-------------------

In addition, we were able to examine a sample of 420 sponsored academies
that opened in the last three years, comparing their latest Ofsted
inspection grade to their predecessor’s last Ofsted grade.
