Ofsted Inspector Pen Profiles in Excel Format
=============================================

On the 13th August 2015 Ofsted updated the pen profiles for their list
of inspectors. This is of interest because Ofsted are brining
inspections of schools in house rather than using contractors.

Unfortunately the file is only available in PDF format on the Ofsted
site

So we’ve converted it to excel here
