Watchsted - Ofsted Annual Report
================================

The [Ofsted Annual
Report](http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/annualreport1213/ "Ofsted Annual Report") was
released on 11th December 2013. The report has a whopping eleven PDF
documents; ‘Commentary’, ‘Schools’, ‘Further education’ and one each for
the ‘Eight Regions’. I’ve detailed some of my thoughts below, I’ve
deliberately highlighted points were I disagreed with the report rather
than list all the bits that I agree with.

**The Proportion of Good or Better Schools**

Early on the commentary draws our attention to this phrase

> *“Nearly eight in 10 schools in England are now good or better, which
> is the highest proportion since Ofsted was founded 20 years ago.”\
> *

I wonder if this phrase is a tiny bit misleading. Would be more accurate
to say;

> *“Nearly eight in 10 schools in England were last inspected as being
> good or better.”*

* \
*And leave it at that? Why;

Firstly I’m not looking for more inspections (teachers don’t need them),
however it can take 3 – 5 years for a school inspected as good to be
inspected again. It might sound pedantic but a school inspected as good
say 3.5 years ago might not be inspected as good today, so you can’t say
with confidence that it is a good school.

Secondly from September 2012 Ofsted (correctly) increased the frequency
of inspections of underperforming schools (based on previous inspection
or detecting changes in performance). Changing the frequency of
inspection in this way will affect the overall proportion of schools
rated as good or outstanding, so a comparison to previous years is
irrelevant, and that means highlighting the proportion in relation to
the last 20 years is irrelevant. 

**Free Schools\
\
**The report says

> *“It is too early to report in detail on the standards achieved in the
> new free schools and very few have been inspected.”*

Just considering the inspection statistics in isolation and ignoring all
other arguments for and against free schools, then that statement is
correct, you can’t draw conclusions on such a small sample. However did
Gove say the Ofsted inspection results were further evidence of the high
standards at free schools at some point? I still think its premature for
that.

**Class room behaviour**

The report says

> *“We have accepted for far too long minor disruption and inattention
> in schools.”\
> *

I agree with the statement, there was some right rotter’s back in my
school days too, however why are Ofsted inspectors rating behaviour
soooo high under the ‘tougher’ inspection framework as shown below?

I would have thought that if it was such a major factor that the
inspectors would be reporting this a little more harshly. 

**Sensitivity Analysis**

When the number of schools in an LA are low a change to just one school
in the LA can have a big affect

For example inspecting just one large **secondary** school in Bracknell
Forrest (which has roughly 6 schools with inspections) can swing the
results . In fact if Ofsted had included the following inspection that
occurred on the 10^th^ September then Bracknel would jump a long way up
the table.

Sandhurst School was last inspected as satisfactory but in September was
inspected and found to be good, its got about a 1000 pupils.

I guess we have to be careful when commenting on small samples 

**Current Inspection Intelligence**

Watchsted was able to reproduce the Local Authority Performance Tables
but with all the inspections that had been **published** up to 10^th^
December 2013.

Here is a snippet showing a massive percentage point increase in
Bracknell Forest secondary schools.

You can see the tables broken down by school phase and see the
associated Ofsted rank here;

[Local Authority Primary Performance
Tables](http://www.angelsolutions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Watchsted-and-Ofsted-Primary-Performance-Tables.pdf)

Although the league positions are pretty similar it’s clear to see that
a point in time comparison is a little dangerous. We are planning on
adding these reports
to [www.watchsted.com](http://www.watchsted.com/) in real-time, updated
on a daily basis from the latest inspection data ….

**The Regions**

The Ofsted report talks about ‘regions’ we thought it would be a good
idea to compare how they are doing so here is a snippet for secondary
schools. (Check out the PDFs for primaries)

That’s it from me.
