Over their first eight issues Academies Week published interviews with
the eight regional school commissioners (RSC). All of the interviews
were published in print and the majority also feature on their website
[http://academiesweek.co.uk/](http://academiesweek.co.uk/) 

[Watchsted](http://www.watchsted.com "www.watchsted.com")collected some
of the data that was used in the published articles.

If you’ve not read through the interviews yet then I recommend you do.
There are a number of common themes within the interviews;

-   RSC responsibilities.
-   Board elections and appointments.
-   Number of academies in rural and coastal areas.
-   Identification of high performing and struggling schools.
-   Strategies to encourage schools to become academies.
-   Strategies to improve performance.
-   More scrutiny in becoming an academy
-   How conflicts of interest are handled.
-   Whistleblowing

Some of the interviews were issued online so you can catch up here
