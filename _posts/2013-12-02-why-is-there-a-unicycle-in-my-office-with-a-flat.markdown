Why is there a unicycle in my office with a flat tire?
======================================================

This can only be believed with photographic evidence.

The office at [Angel Solutions Ltd](http://www.angelsolutions.co.uk/) is
not just decorated but equipped like a circus. 

Am I dreaming?

Apparently someone left the crayons out and a vague plan materialized on
the back of a cigarette packet …

To keep said crayon plan a secret, the staff from Team Angel was
banished from the office only allowed to return when a quest to help
local schools and charities was completed ([read more

Then a very clever lady called Penny Harland of [Harland
Interiors](http://harlandinteriors.co.uk/) clicked her red shoes
together 3 times ….. and LOH-koh-moh-tor!

On returning from their quest Team Angel got a nice surprise fresh
popcorn, fairground mirrors, a huge interactive “blackboard”, a “Big
Top” complete with artificial grass, sofas, juggling props and funny
clocks and yeah a unicycle.
