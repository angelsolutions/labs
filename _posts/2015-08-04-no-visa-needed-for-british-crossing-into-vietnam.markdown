No visa needed for British crossing into Vietnam. Land Border experience.
=========================================================================

I recently travelled from Kep in Cambodia to Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam and
wanted to document the experience so that other British people know what
they need to do since the Vietnam visa rules changed on the 1^st^ July
2015. Basically you can just turn up with your passport its really easy.

There are a number of travel agents in Kep we used Green Tours


Pick up time: 10:40am
 Arrival Time: 10:00pm

* A small bus picked us up from the Hostel on time there were about
10 in the bus.

* Whilst you’re on the bus don’t forget to complete your Cambodia
departure card.

* Take a photo of your passport and photo of the departure card as
you’ll be handing them over later.

* After an hour or two we arrived at the Prek Chark Cross Boarder
Facility 

* We handed over our passports to our driver.

* The driver might ask for a dollar at some point feel free to
decline this it is part of their job that you’ve already paid for.

* If the driver asks about a visa, just say the you are eligible
for a free visa.

* The driver’s friend took the passports to the facility for
processing.

* The driver will get back on and drive about 200 yards into Prek
Chark Cross Boarder Facility 

* You get off with all your bags and go to epidemic control in a
building in front of you

* Fill in form. They will ask for \$1 if you don’t have yellow
fever vaccine cert (it’s not clear if this is a scam I think you might
be able to just walk off after filling the form in) I was 36.6 C

* Go to boarder command office and wait \~15 minutes for the
drivers mate to pick up passports they will be stamped. Passport will
have the date you must exit by, ours said [14th August
2015](x-apple-data-detectors://1) as we arrived on the 31^st^ July.

* Go to hut (driver will tell you where) it’s about 30 yards away

* The man at the hut checks passport and will ask you where you
are going just say “Ho Chi Minh City”.

* Wait at restaurant about 20 yards further up

* A different bus came to pick us up after 15 mins

* We were dropped off at a ticket office at a bus station where we
were issued with a new ticket for another bus. We needed to wait about
an hour for this bus at the station.

* The big bus is pretty amazing with aircon, beds, bags for your
shoes, wifi, bottled water and so on.

* The bus will stop a couple of times for rest breaks, local
vistnamise will hop on the bus temporarily to sell you food.

* You will get dropped off at the main bus station in Ho Chi Minh.

* We stayed in the back packer area aka District 1.
