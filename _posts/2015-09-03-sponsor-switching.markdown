Sponsor Switching
=================

At Watchsted we are interested in academies that have switched sponsor
since academisation. By *‘sponsor switching’* I mean academies that have
joined a sponsor without having been with one before and also those that
left a sponsor or switched to another sponsor.

We’re not the only ones interested in sponsor switches. Thanks to
an [FOI from Janet
Downs](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/names_of_all_academies_changing)
of the rather good [Local Schools
Network](http://www.localschoolsnetwork.org.uk/) we can now see that the
number of academies switching is increasing every year.

**Fig 1: Number of academies switching each year up to September 2015**\

We can see which sponsors have taken on board the most academies. For
example “The White Horse Federation” took on 4 academies (including 2 in
March 2015 that started out with AET).

**Fig 2: Sponsors that have taken on board 2 or more academies**

We can see which sponsors have lost the most schools. For example
Prospects Academies Trust, which announced last year that it was folding

lost 6 schools. Whilst EACT has lost 10

**Fig 3. Sponsors that have lost 2 or more academies**

We can also break it down by region. The East Midlands & Humber region
(RSC Jennifer Bexon-Smith) and the South West region (RSC Sir David
Carter) have seen the greatest number of switches.

To read more about this subject read the FOI
here [https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/names\_of\_all\_academies\_changing](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/names_of_all_academies_changing) 

Also its worth reading an earlier report on this by John Dickens of
Schools Week
here [http://schoolsweek.co.uk/academies-swap-trusts-in-emerging-transfer-market/](http://schoolsweek.co.uk/academies-swap-trusts-in-emerging-transfer-market/).
Looks like the Schools Week version excludes those schools that were not
previously associated to an approved sponsor.
