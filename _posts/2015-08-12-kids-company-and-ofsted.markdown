Kids Company and Ofsted
=======================

One of the angles that [Marc Ashdown](https://twitter.com/marcashdown)
of the BBC considered when looking at [Kids
Company](http://www.kidsco.org.uk/) was who is responsible in terms of
regulation. Using the [Watchsted](http://www.watchsted.com) “engine” I
was able to have a quick look at what Ofsted had said about Kids Company
in their Ofsted reports for Marc. As you can see from the list below
Ofsted praised the association with Kids Company in all of the reports
that we found.
