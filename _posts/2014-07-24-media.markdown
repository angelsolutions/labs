[Watchsted](http://www.watchsted.com "www.watchsted.com")has featured in
national newspapers, conferences, council websites, local media and even
a think tank report.

National Press

Writing in the Guardian, [Richard
Adams](https://twitter.com/RichardA "https://twitter.com/RichardA") used
our statistics to figure out how many academies in the E-Act chain were
rated as inadequate.
[http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/25/sponsors-e-act-academy-schools](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/25/sponsors-e-act-academy-schools "http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/25/sponsors-e-act-academy-schools")

> *According to analysis by [Watchsted](http://www.watchsted.com) - a
> database of Ofsted reports - five out of 18 E-Act schools have the
> lowest possible rating of inadequate, and six are rated “requires
> improvement”. Only one, Shenley Academy in Birmingham, has received an
> “outstanding” top rating.*

Richard also used our statistics to get the section 5 inspections for
free
schools. http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/apr/24/greenwich-free-school-ofsted-inspection

> *According to data collected by [Watchsted](http://www.watchsted.com/)
> – a site that tracks Ofsted inspection results – nine free schools
> have now been graded as “requires improvement” while four have been
> graded “inadequate,” the lowest rating. Seven have been rated as
> “outstanding” and 22 as “good”, out of 42 in total.*

Intriguingly Ofsted removed the Tauheedul Islam Boys’ High School’s
report on the 25th April. Thank’s to an inspector from CfBT for the
heads
up [https://twitter.com/Parper/status/459733976517967872](https://twitter.com/Parper/status/459733976517967872 "https://twitter.com/Parper/status/459733976517967872")

[Warwick
Mansell](https://twitter.com/warwickmansell "https://twitter.com/warwickmansell")
used our statistics, combined with his own inside knowledge (Which
turned out to be about the The Hawthorne’s Free
School). http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/apr/29/free-schools-ofsted-failure-rate-higher-state

> *Overall, 79% of state schools are rated good or outstanding compared
> with only 68% of free schools, according to our analysis, based in
> part on figures provided by
> the [Watchsted](http://www.watchsted.com/) website. Last July,
> ministers promoted their free schools policy by boasting that
> three-quarters of the first 24 free schools were judged [good or
> outstanding](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/three-quarters-of-free-schools-rated-good-or-outstanding-by-ofsted-at-first-inspection).*

Nigel Nelson (although I actually spoke to his colleague) from the
Mirror mentioned our statistics in an article
here [http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/free-schools-michael-gove-taking-3523762\#ixzz31QYNImUk](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/free-schools-michael-gove-taking-3523762#ixzz31QYNImUk) 

> *Of 45 checked by the schools’ watchdog Ofsted since the start of last
> year, five have been condemned as “inadequate” and 10 told they need
> improvement.*
>
> *Website [www.watchsted.com](http://www.watchsted.com) say schools’
> failure rate is nearly 11% compared to just three per cent in regular
> schools.*

For clarity its worth pointing out that comparing the
**percentage****of free schools** that have been found inadequate to the
**percentage** **of ALL schools** that are rated inadequate is not
recommended. If you want to know why get in touch or read about the
underlying reasons
here [http://www.naht.org.uk/welcome/news-and-media/blogs/warwick-mansell/digging-beneath-the-surface-of-ofsteds-record-rise-claim/](http://www.naht.org.uk/welcome/news-and-media/blogs/warwick-mansell/digging-beneath-the-surface-of-ofsteds-record-rise-claim/ "http://www.naht.org.uk/welcome/news-and-media/blogs/warwick-mansell/digging-beneath-the-surface-of-ofsteds-record-rise-claim/")

Warwick Mansell used our statistics on the 12th August 2014 when noting
how the Academies Enterprise Trust had fared “a little” better than some
other chains after facing focused inspections

> *Published Ofsted reports on the AET academies inspected in June show
> it has fared better than expected in the recent series of
> “co-ordinated” Ofsted inspections (triggered when there are concerns
> about an academy chain). Information provided to us by the [Watchsted
> website](http://www.watchsted.com/) shows that eight schools were
> judged good, with the remaining six deemed to “require improvement”.*

The BBC News education correspondent [Sean
Coughlan](https://twitter.com/seanjcoughlan "https://twitter.com/seanjcoughlan") quoted
Watchsted early statistics prior to an Ofsted announcement 
being released regarding a wave of no notice inspections. As the article
was part of rolling news you can’t find it on the BBC anymore, however
its still available
here [http://schoolsimprovement.net/no-notice-ofsted-inspections-reveal-school-weaknesses/ ](http://schoolsimprovement.net/no-notice-ofsted-inspections-reveal-school-weaknesses/ "http://schoolsimprovement.net/no-notice-ofsted-inspections-reveal-school-weaknesses/").
This is what Sean said;

> *Ofsted has not yet named the 35 schools included in this series of
> inspections, but the Watchsted website, which tracks inspection
> reports, has been able to identify more than 30 schools receiving
> no-notice visits during those weeks.*

[Stephen
Exley](https://twitter.com/stephenexley "https://twitter.com/stephenexley") from
the TES wrote an article about the variation in grades between
inspectors. The article was first published
here; [https://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2014/11/20/ofsted-data-reveals-39-inconsistency-39-between-inspectors-heads-claim.aspx ](https://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2014/11/20/ofsted-data-reveals-39-inconsistency-39-between-inspectors-heads-claim.aspx "https://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2014/11/20/ofsted-data-reveals-39-inconsistency-39-between-inspectors-heads-claim.aspx") and
the full article is available here
[https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6451456](https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6451456 "https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6451456")
he stated 

> *The findings – collated by the Watchsted website and published
> exclusively by TES – have sparked serious concerns among headteachers
> about the variability of Ofsted inspections, which they say is causing
> “fear” in schools across the country.*

I would have liked this article more if the TES had discussed some of
the many reasons for grade variation between inspectors. For example
grades will vary between inspectors if the underlying profile of schools
varies, which is likely since inspection outcomes vary geographically
and inspectors are selected for inspection based on their skill set and
experience. Its also worth pointing out that inspectors generally work
in teams.

Academies Week

Academies Week is a national weekly newspaper for those interested in
Education in England. It has some outstanding reporters and editors.
Watchsted has featured in EVERY issue (8 so far, print and online). Each
issue has shown a close-up of a regional school commissioner. Watchsted
provided some of the statistics to support Academies Week in producing
their articles. Their team includes [Laura
McInerney](https://twitter.com/miss_mcinerney "https://twitter.com/miss_mcinerney"), [Nick
Linford](https://twitter.com/NickLinford "https://twitter.com/NickLinford") and [Philip
Nye](https://twitter.com/philipnye "https://twitter.com/philipnye"). You
can access the 8 online issues here;

Think Tank

[Civitas ](http://www.civitas.org.uk/education/PTG.php "http://www.civitas.org.uk/education/PTG.php")is
a think tank (Described as a "right-of-centre think-tank" by the
Times [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/education/article3984346.ece](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/education/article3984346.ece)).
In July 2014 they published a report that considered how Ofsted
considers teaching styles.

Watchsted verified a limited number of facts and provided counter
arguments to some of the themes in the report written by [Robert
Peal](https://twitter.com/goodbyemrhunter "https://twitter.com/goodbyemrhunter").
For this role Watchsted was mentioned in the acknowledgements section.

Early Years

Liz Roberts wrote about Watchsted in Nursery
World http://www.nurseryworld.co.uk/nursery-world/news/1147594/tool-track-inspections

I spoke to Liz after the article was written as I really like the annual
Day Nursery Chain statistics that Nursery World produce.

Conferences 

Advanced Watchsted functionality is available to local authorities
through their [NCER](https://www.ncer.org "https://www.ncer.org")
membership, within a service called Nexus. Nexus helps local authorities
by presenting Watchsted’s inspection data, alongside contextual data,
attainment data and local intelligence. 

The Local Government Association held a conference that included
Watchsted functionality in April 2014
[http://www.local.gov.uk/events/-/journal\_content/56/10180/5885450/EVENT](http://www.local.gov.uk/events/-/journal_content/56/10180/5885450/EVENT "http://www.local.gov.uk/events/-/journal_content/56/10180/5885450/EVENT") and
announced new features in July
2014 [http://www.local.gov.uk/schools-and-education/-/journal\_content/56/10180/6396805/ARTICLE](http://www.local.gov.uk/schools-and-education/-/journal_content/56/10180/6396805/ARTICLE "http://www.local.gov.uk/schools-and-education/-/journal_content/56/10180/6396805/ARTICLE")

The NCER held a conference in May 2014 that demonstrated how data from
Parent View is used within an alerting system.

[Laura
McInerney](http://lauramcinerney.com/) "http://lauramcinerney.com/)")referenced
[Watchsted](http://www.watchsted.com "www.watchsted.com")free school
statistics at the [Northern Rocks
conference](http://northernrocks2014.wordpress.com/speakers/%20 "http://northernrocks2014.wordpress.com/speakers/") 

Watchsted statistics are often used elsewhere, such as council websites,
for
example; [http://www.southtyneside.info/index.aspx?articleid=22589](http://www.southtyneside.info/index.aspx?articleid=22589 "http://www.southtyneside.info/index.aspx?articleid=22589") and
in local media for
