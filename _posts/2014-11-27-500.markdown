500
===

I recently took a sample of 500 anonymised lesson plans and investigated
how many learning episodes the plans contained and what was the
proportion of teacher vs. student led episodes.

A summary of that research is written up here

Ross McGill who has adapted and promoted the 5 minute plan for many
years re-posted it on his blog here

The research is based on a sample of plans from the digital 5 minute
lesson plan. This means that it does not reflect the practice of all
teachers. However I recently discussed this research with one of my
friends Gareth who has more than 10 years experience as a teacher.

The research suggested that lesson episodes were more likely to be
planned as student led rather than teacher led, especially in episodes
toward the end of the lesson. Gareth wondered if this was a reflection
of the way teachers are trained, as the profession may have moved toward
student led activities.

The research suggested that lessons were more likely to have 4 episodes
than 3 or 2. We were not sure about this one. Do more frequent shorter
learning episodes allow a teacher to maintain the pace of a lesson? Or
does it lead to insufficient time for a student to absorb the
information? There is not a suggested number of episodes in the digital
5 minute plan. Gareth wondered if plans might vary for lessons were a
teacher is set to be observed.

Looking at a couple of comments on the article it’s important to point
out that lessons might be more dynamic than what a plan might suggest.
