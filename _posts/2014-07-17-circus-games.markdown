Circus Games
============

What happens when you give 15 people a challenge, a 30 pound budget and
a theme?

At Angel every month, the team put down what they are doing to take part
in an ‘Innovation Day’ where they can work on whatever project they
want. This time it coincided with the opening party for our new
Circus-themed office (more to follow on that in another post). The crew
split off into three teams and each team designed, created and tested
their own circus game.

Along with numerous trips to B & Q the teams sourced paint, paper
cut-outs, electronics, a Christmas tree stump and even a pair of old
trousers (see if you can spot what they were used for..).

So visitors to the office can play “Shooting Angels”, “The Steady Hand
Grandstand” or take on “The Clown”.
