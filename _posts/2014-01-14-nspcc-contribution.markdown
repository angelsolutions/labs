NSPCC Contribution
==================

A while back I created a quick start guide for the mighty NodeXL.

At the time I hinted to a project that I’m carrying out in Q1 of 2014.

That project assesses how our circus themed firm Angel Solutions Ltd
works with a network of leading thinkers who work at Local Authorities
to better understand the needs of the many.

As a way of giving love, hugs and all-round thanks to those beautiful
chaps and chapesses who took part in the research at Angel and
throughout Local Authorities in England I donated £80 (£2 per response)
to the NSPCC. (Rounds up to £100 with gift aid)

Just to make sure that Samwise does not suspect me to be a villain I’ve
done this through justgiving
here http://www.justgiving.com/JohnWinstanleyDissertation

Anyway here’s a reminder of what the network looks like and thanks to
everyone who took part.
