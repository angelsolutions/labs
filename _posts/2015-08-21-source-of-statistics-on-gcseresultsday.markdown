Source of Statistics on #GCSEResultsDay
=======================================

You might have noticed that on GCSE and A Level results day we are hit
with lots of statistics from the media. You can get actually get your
hands on the raw data from the Joint Council for Qualifications here

[http://www.jcq.org.uk/examination-results](http://www.jcq.org.uk/examination-results)

The data is by subject so you can find out the percentage of pupils that
got between an A\* and a C in say English but you can’t find out the
percentage of pupils that got between an A\* and a C in both English and
Maths combined. Also it’s all national level data so it’s not given at
the provider, LA or pupil level.

As an example if we look at students who took chemistry GCSE in England
(just England not the whole of the UK) then we find that 18.1% of
females attained an A\* in Chemistry compared to 13.5% of males.

The documents are published every year so we can look back. As an
example over the last 3 years we can see the gender gap has widened 

2015: 4.6% (Female 18.1, Male 13.5)\
2014: 3.8% (Female 16.3, Male 12.5)\
2013: 3.5% (Female 18.4, Male 14.9)

Note I’m not reading anything into that gap, just using it as an example
for those who might want to play with the data when its published on the
day.

Does anyone know if the data is available in Excel format? I would be
interested to know.
